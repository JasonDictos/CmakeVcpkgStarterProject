# CmakeVcpkgStarterProject
Here's a simple boilerplate setup for using vcpkg in manifest mode, clang-format, and cmake presets. 

To use just open it up with vscode, install the reccomended extensions, and then run "CMake Configure Project"

You'll need vs2019 somewhere on your system, as well as cmake version 3.20.5 or greater somewhere as well.
